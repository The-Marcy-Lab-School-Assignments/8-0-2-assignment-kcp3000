# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

Exposing API keys in frontend code is risky because it makes them accessible to anyone who can inspect the code or network requests from the browser. 

As to why it's better to fetch in the backend instead, when requests are made server-side, the API keys stay on the server and are never exposed to the client. Only the server has direct access to the keys, making it harder for unauthorized users to access them.
